**Mobile version of GreenMath using Ionic Framework**

**An applied algebra learning app for Years 1 - 13 NCEA using an ecological theme.**  
**Built with MEAN + Ionic using an API REST <-> CLIENT architecture.**

**Features:**
- Engaging interactive content for users of all levels.
- Use very basic AI to generate problems and assess progress.
- This makes the app very responsive since interaction is based on fast transfer of Json and SVG.
- Json for problems and user progress profile persisted by MongoDB backend.
- User can get feedback profile constructed using D3.js.

**Phase 2. Extending the basic architecture and designing for scale and eventual migration to Angular 2 :**  
- Models: Design schema for fast access, optimised 1-1 embedding and minimised M-M storage.  
- Controllers: Focus on lean controllers, modularity and component directives.  
- TypeScript: Start embedding it. 

_**Feedback appreciated!**_
